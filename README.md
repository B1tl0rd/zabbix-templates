  - **Service MySQL**
    - Applications:
      - new ```SVC::MySQL::cfg``` for all read configuration parameters
      - new ```SVC::MySQL::Com``` for all Com_* metrics

ut I need to standarize thuis before first officially announced release of the templates)

## Notes and Guidelines:
* Each template has own version tag which is the copy of the whole zabbix-templates package version tag in which last changes has released
* Each template in the description field has the last modification date and internal version
* If it is something which needs to be done to use those templates it is described in each template within description notes
* Naming convention for the items names, applications and triggers must adhere naming convention using 2-4 letter abbreviations:
  ```
  <CLASS>::<Name>
  <CLASS>::<SUBCLASS>::<Name>
  ```
  ##### Items Examples:
  ```
  HW::CPU
  MEM::Total Memory
  NET::ICMP::Loss
  NTP::WTS::Clock Frequency Adjustment
  ```
  Above provide a parseable name, allowing us to distinguish between and categorise those objects.
  Such convention is quite easy to handle as the pattern in alarming layer allowing, for example, send all trigger with SYS:: in the beginning name of the template to exact team.
  Such pattern is possible to use part of the general interface on communication with external services.
* Do not use {HOSTNAME} macros in triggers, as web frontend from Monitoring -> Triggers has a list with "host" column name on the host where the trigger is active (it is waste of space on the web page)
* All zabbix agent items should be specified as ```zabbix agent (active)``` items
* All graphs resolution needs to be 1200x300
* All SNMP items should be as SNMPv2 and ```{$SNMP_COMMUNITY}``` as SNMP read community name

Because all templates are using the same graphs resolution, item types and SNMP protocol version and community name with such settings are easy to change in all templates agent items type to passive one or change all other settings across all templates before import them.
